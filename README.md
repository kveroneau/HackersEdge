# Official Hacker's Edge Online Multiplayer Game Source Code

Since I have not worked on this project for years, and I've been chatting with some
developers about it.  I thought it was finally time to republish it onto GitHub.

This project was originally pushed up as a Mercurial repository on BitBucket.org, but
BitBucket.org decided to delete every single Mercurial repo without even converting them
over to Git repos.  So I officially lost faith in BitBucket.org entirely now!

Hopefully this code can help others learn as much as I have about servers, virtual machines,
emulators, and a bunch of other fun stuff too.  Enjoy!
