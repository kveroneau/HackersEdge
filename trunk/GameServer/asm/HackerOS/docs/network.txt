HackerOS Networking guide

HackerOS comes with a network driver NETDRV.SYS, which
provides a few useful functions to user programs.

There is also a userspace program called ipconfig.bin
which allows you to view your IP address or change
the status of the network card.

$ ipconfig up
This will bring up the network if it was brought down.

$ ifconfig down
This will bring the interface offline, kicking any connections.
