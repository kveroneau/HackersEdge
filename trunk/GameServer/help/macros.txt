Hacker's Edge IC Shell macros guide

Do you often type the same IC shell command over and over?
Do you want to just press a single button to connect to a host?

Look no further than the wonderful world of macros!  With macros, you can
set a function key on your keyboard to automatically enter in an IC command.

Here's an example to get you started, of course fill in your own host IP address:

falken% macro 5 "connect 96.219.144.22"

This will set the "F5" key to automatically run this command when it's pressed.

Macros will not work while you are connected to a host, however very soon you will
be able to use these function keys within your own 65c02 programs, so you can build
your own macro system at that point within the OS itself.  Neat!

Enjoy the new wonderful world of macros!
