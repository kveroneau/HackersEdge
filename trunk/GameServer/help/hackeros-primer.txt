Thank you for choose HackerOS for your 65c02 computer. HackerOS gives
you the power to easily manage files and make network connections to
other machines. In this primer, we will go through the basics of
HackerOS and how to get up and running as quickly as possible. This
primer will be updated from time to time, so please check back for
any future updates.

This is what you should see after booting up HackerOS, it will first
boot from the code within the ROM chip, which will in turn load a
bootloader program called BOOT.SYS from your disk. The bootloader will
then look for and load KERNEL.SYS, and execute it. From here the
HackerKernel takes over and starts up HackerOS.
