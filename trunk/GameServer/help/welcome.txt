Hello and welcome to Hacker's Edge!

This is your official welcome package which should have arrived
with your Hacker's Edge rig you recently ordered.

You should carefully read all the documents and manuals which came
with your PC, as they will explain the basics on how to get started
and connected to the Hacker's Edge Internet.  The next guide you
should read is the "Getting Started" book, which explains the basics
on how to set-up and connect up your machine to the network.

Good Luck!
