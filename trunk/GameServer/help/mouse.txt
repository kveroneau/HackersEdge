Your guide to the Hacker's Edge BlackMouse++ GS

Thank you for your purchase of the BlackMouse++ GS!  You can use your mouse in any
compatible computer software you might have.  If you plan on developing your own,
here is a getting started guide on how to program for this new piece of tech:

This guide assumes that your I/O page is in the range of $ff00-$ffff

The first thing you will want to do, is write an interrupt callback routine in your
software.  This can live anywhere in your machine's main memory.  Set the vector
at $ffdd,$ffde to your callback function.  Your callback should return using an RTI.

You should disable interrupts within your routine to avoid problems.

You can either set a flag in your routine and RTI to have your program manage it
somehow, or you can check for which button and where the mouse was pressed using
the following API:

  $ffd9 - The button pressed
  $ffda - The column where the click occurred.
  $ffdb - The row where the click occurred.

Lastly, you will want to enable the mouse in your software, there is a terminal bit
set you can change for this to be done.  Here is an example to enable the mouse:

LDA $ffdc
ORA #$40
STA $ffdc

Likewise to disable the mouse again, use the following code:

LDA $ffdc
EOR #$40
STA $ffdc

And more importantly, enjoy using your BlackMouse++ GS!
