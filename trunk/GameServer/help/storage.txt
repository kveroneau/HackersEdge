Hacker's Edge storage guide

Did you ever want an easy way to transfer data from one machine to another?
Now you can with the magic of our new 4k floppy disks!  Purchase one from
the Hacker's Edge hardware store today!

Once you have your high tech floppy disk at your side, "attach" it to a machine,
copy files to it, then "detach" it when you are done.

You can easily view your inventory of "storage" devices any time, including OS
installation disks which may be needed to install your machine's system software.
