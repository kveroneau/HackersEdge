In this Getting Started guide you will learn the basics about
how to navigate Hacker's Edge and connect to your machine.

By now, you should have at least found the "help" command, this
command is available in most systems in Hacker's Edge.  If you
ever need to know what commands are available at any given time,
you should try using the "help" command.  Give it a try now!

Right now, you are in a mode called IC(in-character), all actions
made in this mode is from the point of view of your character.

Let's try connecting to your first host, you can either type in
the commands in full or use tab completion.  I recommend reading
the tab-completion guide for more information on this.  Let's
connect using tab-completion as it requires very little keystrokes:

con<tab><tab><enter>

When you press the tab key on your keyboard, you should immediately
notice it's effect on your terminal.  Since you begin with only a
single host, the second tab there will complete to the only host you
have in your arsenal.

Currently in the open beta, there is a play ground of toys to beta
test as time goes on.  Depending on the machine type you choose,
you may be in for a rough ride.  I highly recommend choosing
"HackerOS 65c02" as your machine to have the most enjoyment in
the open beta.
