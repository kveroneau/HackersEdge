Tab completion is going to be your best friend when working in
Hacker's Edge.  For example, did you know you could have used
the tab key to read this document in only 5 keystrokes?  Here's
how:  m<tab>t<tab><enter>

You can use this trick through any shell on your Hacker's Edge PC
which supports this feature.  This guide will be updated in the
future with developer APIs which you can use in your own programs
to enable tab-completion in say a custom shell program you create
yourself!  Now your playing with Power!  TAB POWER!
