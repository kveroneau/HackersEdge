Did you know that you can actually access your host files
over the standard FTP protocol?

The unfortunate bit here is that it hasn't been fully tested
with every single FTP client that exists, but support will
be ongoing to improve it's overall compatibility.

If you wanted to give it a shot, just point your FTP software here:

FTP Server: ftp.hackers-edge.com
FTP Port: 2121
FTP Username: Your character username
FTP Password: Your character password

This feature technically breaks the forth wall, but for the sake
of usability the game gods shouldn't mind too much...

Anyways, this super feature only found in Hacker's Edge allows you
to both download and upload files from the hosts your character
has in it's inventory.  So, you could say assemble a binary file
locally on your real world PC, and then upload the program to the
game world to wreck havoc on the virtual Internet.
