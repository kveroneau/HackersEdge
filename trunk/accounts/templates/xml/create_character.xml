    <body>
    <p>Let me explain the character creation a bit for you in brief.</p>
    <p>Username and password should be straightforward, these are what you will sign into the game world using.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Network</strong> dropdown allows you to select a particular in-game network, this more or less chooses
which IP address your initial machine is assigned.  More networks will be available and vanish as time goes on.</p>
    <p>The most confusion selection here is the <strong>Machine type</strong>.  Depending what you select here can drastically
change your gameplay experience.  If you haven't played Hacker's Edge before, I highly recommend choosing 
<strong>HackerOS 65c02</strong>, it is currently the most user-friendly out of the bunch.</p>
