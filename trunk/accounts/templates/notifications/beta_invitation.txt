Hello {{user.get_full_name|default:user.username}}!

  This is your official Hacker's Edge closed beta invitation!  Your lucky account has
been chosen to participate.

  In case you have forgotten, your username is "{{user.username}}".  If you forgot your
password, please use the link below to request a new one.

  If you created your Hacker's Edge account a couple years ago, much has changed in the
development since then.  Now, the entire game is terminal-based.  Although, the game has
been designed to be as friendly to users' whom might not know how to use a command-line,
it can be a bit of a learning curve at first.  You should check out the latest tutorials
and documentation in the "Help Center", which has a link below.

  Your account has also been added to a special group with exclusive forum access to a beta
discussion topic.  Please use this forum to discuss any bugs you may encounter, or any other
enhancement you think would benefit the game and other players.

  This game is also driven from user created content, if you have some programming skills, you
can create custom applications, rootkits, viruses, trojans, malware, and other fun stuff.  The
game world is your virtual playground to cause chaos on the virtual network.
